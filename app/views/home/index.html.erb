          <h3>Purpose of Camp</h3>
          <p>California Christadelphian Kids Camp provides young believers with an immersive week of Bible study, fellowship, and spiritual growth. Through focused study of the Last Week of Christ's Ministry, campers will deepen their understanding of Jesus's sacrifice and develop a stronger foundation in God's Word.</p>
          <p>Our camp combines engaging Bible lessons, interactive discussions, and meaningful activities in a supportive environment. Campers will build lasting friendships with fellow young Christadelphians while exploring the profound events from the Last Supper to Christ's Ascension as recorded in Luke 22:1-24:53.</p>
          <p>Led by experienced teachers Brother Josh Hodge and Nathan Bartholomew, this week-long study will help children grow in faith and understanding of God's plan through His Son.</p>
