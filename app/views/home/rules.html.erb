      <!-- Introduction -->

        <p class="intro-text">
          <strong>God instructs us:</strong><br>
          But thou, O man of God…follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness…be thou
          an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit. Meditate upon these things, give
          thyself wholly to them… (1 Timothy 6:11; 4:12, 15)
        </p>
        <p>
          If these principles are believed and respected by all, then the following necessary requirements will
          receive your full support.

            <strong>Smoking, Alcoholic Beverages, Drugs:</strong> Our purpose is to shut out the world by providing a
            secluded environment amidst the handiwork of the Almighty. The possession of tobacco products,
            alcoholic beverages and non-medicinal drugs violates this purpose. Possession of such objects will
            be dealt with by disciplinary action and all items will be confiscated.

            worldly logos or advertisements. Please no spaghetti straps, strapless clothing, short shorts or
