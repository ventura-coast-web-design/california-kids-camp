# Do not run db:prepare here when starting the web server. On Fly.io the DB may
# be asleep when the machine starts, so db:prepare can block and we never reach
# Puma — health checks then fail (app not listening on 0.0.0.0:3000). Migrations
# and schema setup run in release_command (bin/fly-release). Start Puma immediately
# so we listen on 0.0.0.0:PORT; ConnectionRetry middleware handles transient DB issues.
